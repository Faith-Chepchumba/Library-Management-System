# **Library Management System**

**Project Overview**

The **Library Management System** is a robust and scalable application designed to simplify library operations. Built using the **Spring Framework** and **SQL** for database management, the system handles essential tasks such as catalog management, user management, transaction processing, fine calculation, and report generation. The intuitive interface ensures that both library staff and users can efficiently manage and access library resources.

**Key Features**

•	**Catalog Management:** Efficiently manages the addition, deletion, and updating of library resources (books, journals, etc.).

•	**User Management:** Handles user registrations, profile management, and authentication.

•	**Transaction Management:** Manages book lending, returns, renewals, and overdue fines.

•	**Fine Calculation:** Automatically calculates fines for overdue items.

•	**Report Generation:** Generates detailed reports on library usage, transactions, and fines.

**Technologies Used**

•	**Programming Language:** Java

•	**Frameworks:** Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring MVC)

•	**Database:** SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

•	**Tools:** Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA for Java development, Git for version control

**Installation & Setup**

1.	**Clone the repository**:
